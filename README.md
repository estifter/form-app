# This is a project I used to help me learn React
As such, it isn't under active development. It mostly served as a playground for me to try out Redux and get used to good design patterns in React.

If I did it over again there is plenty I would do differently. See my [mapt](https://github.com/estifter/mapt) directory for a more current version of my skillset.

## What it is
The intention was to build a drag and drop form editor that could be used to replace forms that are currently in excel. It would offer a similar formula syntax for non-programmers to use and allow a configurable json output to be sent to your own choice server. The thought was that company's own IT could handle data security, etc., while the business users could easily create and distribute complicated forms. There wouldn't be a waiting period between needing a form and someone programming one which as we all know leads to excel sheets getting emailed around 100 times.
